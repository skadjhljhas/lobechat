## Configuring Authentik Authentication Service

## Authentik Configuration Flow

<Steps>
  ### Create an Authentik Application Provider

  In your Authentik instance, use the administrator account to go to **Admin Interface** -> **Applications** -> **Providers** and create a new provider.

  Select **OAuth2/OpenID Provider** as the provider type. Fill in the provider name, select the authentication flow and authorization flow.

  In the `Redirect URL/Origin (regex)` field, fill in:

  ```bash
  https://your-domain/api/auth/callback/authentik
  ```

  <Callout type={'info'}>
    - You can fill in or modify the `Redirect URL/Origin (regex)` later, but make sure the filled in URL matches the deployed URL.
    - Replace `your-domain` with your own domain name
  </Callout>

  Click **Done**

  After the creation is successful, click **Applications** on the left -> **Create**, fill in the name and Slug, select the provider created in the previous step, and click **Create**.

  After the application provider is created, click the corresponding provider to enter the details page, click **Edit**, and save the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

  Copy the URL of `OpenID Configuration Issuer` and save it.
